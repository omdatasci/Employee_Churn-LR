# Employee_Churn-LR
Employee Churn prediction using Logistic Regression model.

This model helps to find out which employee will leave the company by analysing various factors like tenure, age, income etc related to that employee.

Projects steps:

1)Download a CSV data file of Employee Churn from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets. This dataset contains various features which can help our model for accurate prediction.

2)Identified the most relevant features with different techniques(Variance, Mutual Info. classification) to improve the predictive power of the model.

3)Developed and trained predictive models using Logistic Regression technique.

4)Built a web app of that model using flask framework and deploy the model into production environment with the help of ngrok host platform.
